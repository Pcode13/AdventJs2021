You have received a letter ✉️ with all the gifts you must prepare. The thing is that it is a text string and it is very difficult to read 😱. Thank goodness they have put each gift separately by space! (although be careful, because being children, they may have snuck in more spaces than necessary)

We have also noticed that some words come with a _ in front of the word, for example _playstation, which means that it is crossed out and does not have to be counted.

Transform the text into an object that contains the name of each gift and the times it appears. For example, if we have the text:

const letter = 'bike car ball _playstation bike car plush'
When executing the method it should return the following:

const gifts = listGifts(letter)

console.log(gifts)
/*
{
  bike: 2,
  car: 2,
  ball: 1,
  plush: 1
}
*/
Keep in mind that the tests can be more exhaustive... 😝 Be careful with counting empty spaces!
