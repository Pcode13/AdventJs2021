Consider a list/array of sheep. Each sheep has a name and a color. Make a function that returns a list of all the sheep that have that color rojo and that also have names containing both the letters nY a, regardless of order, capitalization, or spaces.

For example, if we have the sheep:

const ovejas = [
  { name: 'Noa', color: 'azul' },
  { name: 'Euge', color: 'rojo' },
  { name: 'Navidad', color: 'rojo' },
  { name: 'Ki Na Ma', color: 'rojo'},
  { name: 'AAAAAaaaaa', color: 'rojo' },
  { name: 'Nnnnnnnn', color: 'rojo'}
]

When executing the method it should return the following:

const ovejasFiltradas = contarOvejas(ovejas)

console.log(ovejasFiltradas)

// [{ name: 'Navidad', color: 'rojo' },
//  { name: 'Ki Na Ma', color: 'rojo' }]
Remember! It must contain both the letters 'a' and 'n' in the name . Don't count sheep that only have one of the letters, they must have both.
