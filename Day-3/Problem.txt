The Grinch is opening the letters that were meant for Santa Claus and he's leaving them in a mess. 😱

Letters are a string of text that includes gifts and parentheses ().

To know if a card is valid ✅, you must check that the parentheses close correctly and that they are not empty.

But be careful! Because the Grinch has left curly brackets {and brackets [inside the parentheses, which makes them invalid . Luckily, he only left them in the middle of the parentheses...

Examples:

"bici coche (balón) bici coche peluche" // -> ✅
"(muñeca) consola bici" // ✅

"bici coche (balón bici coche" // -> ❌
"peluche (bici [coche) bici coche balón" // -> ❌
"(peluche {) bici" // -> ❌
"() bici" // ❌
      
Create a function that, by passing the text of the letter, returns truewhether it is valid and falseif not. And put an end to the Grinch's prank!
